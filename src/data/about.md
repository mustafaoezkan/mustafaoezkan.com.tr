# Intro

I'm an Expert Software Engineer at Yapı Kredi Technology. I work on core banking systems, particularly focusing on time deposit application development. My stack includes Java Spring Boot, React.js, and Oracle. I’m also involved in large-scale architectural transformation efforts—helping migrate monolithic applications to microservices.  

# Ongoing Projects at Yapı Kredi Technology

#### Core Banking (Time Deposit Application Development)

As part of the Time Deposit Application Development team, I develop and maintain deposit-related applications using Java Spring Boot, React.js, and Oracle. I play an active role in transforming legacy monolithic systems into scalable microservices. In addition to full stack development, I write unit tests (JUnit, Mockito), design REST APIs, and work with batch job automation using UC4 in a regulated banking environment.
