# Intro
I'm currently a Software Engineer at Huawei. Though I have more experience on the frontend side, I've worked across the backend, mobile, and cloud environments, contributing to a variety of projects. My journey has exposed me to diverse technologies, and I continue to explore and grow across different tech domains.

# Ongoing Projects at Huawei

#### HMS Core
In this project, I am part of the team working on Huawei Mobile Service Kits, which serve around 5 million users. I help build React Native plugins for different kits such as Location Kit, Account Kit, ADS Kit, and so on. I work with Java and React Native.<br><br>

#### Internal Projects
I’m also part of a project where we are developing an internal system. Here, I play a full-stack role using both React and Java Spring Boot, which has allowed me to strengthen my backend development skills.

# Past Projects at Huawei

#### Dynamic Tag Manager (DTM)
I contributed to the Huawei Dynamic Tag Manager (similar to Google Tag Manager). My role involved coordinating with vendors to integrate their products into the DTM platform, as well as managing and refining the scripts. I used JavaScript throughout the process, working in tag analysis, customer communication, script optimization, and system integration. It was a hands-on project where I also prepared documentation.<br><br>

#### Astrograph
I worked on an open-source graph library from scratch. My focus was on adding JSON support so that users could export and import graph objects in JSON format. It gave me great experience with both JavaScript and TypeScript for library development. On the demo side, I utilized Vue.js and React.js.<br><br>

#### AppCube
On this project, I played a full-stack role. I worked on everything from payment system integrations to mobile web views and REST API integrations. The technologies I mainly used here were Vue.js and TypeScript.<br><br>

#### EBG Partner
This was a challenging project involving a large-scale education platform used in many countries (200,000 ICT Academy students annually across 170+ countries). As a frontend developer using Vue.js, I worked on solving bugs, building new features, and integrating backend APIs into the frontend.

# Past Experiences

#### CTech Internship
During my university years, I worked as a mobile developer at CTech, where I developed a mobile application that streamed live video using the RTMP protocol. Flutter was the main technology I worked with in this project.<br><br>

#### University IT Internship
I also interned at my university’s IT department, working as a full-stack developer. I built an inventory management system using PostgreSQL, React, and Node.js (Express).<br><br>

#### Kindergarten Management System
Along with a group of friends, I developed a kindergarten management system during my university days. I worked on both frontend and backend sides. The frontend was built with React, while the backend was in Golang. We used PostgreSQL as the database.

# Hobbies & Interests
In my free time, I enjoy walking, trying new foods, and exploring new places. I also love watching series—my favorite is Better Call Saul. I’m a huge fan of gaming as well, particularly Rocket League and Rainbow Six Siege.
